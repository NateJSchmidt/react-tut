# Some simple React.js and Bootstrap examples

This repository contains some simple React.js and Bootstrap examples.  The following are the highlights:
* Utilizing bootstrap's navbar to setup a nav bar at the top of the page that lists out the different examples.
* A sample tic-tac-toe game written in React.js that is based off of the [React.js tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).
* Using the JS Popover component from the bootstrap library.

The above examples highlight the following key concepts:
* What libraries need to be included for development and how to import them in deployment.
* How to use a JS-based, Bootstrap 5 component (Bootstrap 5 no longer depends on JQuery so you no longer need to mess with that stuff).
* The navbar component demonstrates how to pass around data in the React.js framework.
